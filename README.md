# Akinator

## Decription

This repository contains my *"Akinator"* project. I've made it for *Ilya Dedinskiy's C language course*. In this project I used *Binary search tree* 
for implementing Akinator. The hardest part of this project is a function, that read tree from `.txt` file. It was realy interesting work. 
Here I used *C++ languange* for working with strings. In tree implementation I used *C languange* and working with memory. You can see it in my code. 
I've also used *GraphViz* for making helpful and beautiful dumps.
